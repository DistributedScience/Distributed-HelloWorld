# Distributed-HelloWorld

[Distributed-Something](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-Something) is an app to run encapsulated docker containers that do... something in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
We are interested in scientific image analysis so we have used it for [CellProfiler](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-CellProfiler), [Fiji](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-Fiji), and [BioFormats2Raw](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-OmeZarrMaker).
You can use it for whatever you want!

Here, as an example, we have used it to make an app that lets you say hello to the world, as well as list some of your favorite things. The full code changes are available [here](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-HelloWorld/pull/1/files)

Happy Distributing!
