# Distributed-HelloWorld

[Distributed-Something](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-Something) is an app to run encapsulated docker containers that do... something in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
We are interested in scientific image analysis so we have used it for [CellProfiler](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-CellProfiler), [Fiji](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-Fiji), and [BioFormats2Raw](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-OmeZarrMaker).
You can use it for whatever you want!

Here, as an example, we have used it to make an app that lets you say hello to the world, as well as list some of your favorite things.
We have provided Distributed-HelloWorld to assist you in the creation of your own Distributed-Something application.
You can see the full code changes necessary to make a simple, functioning application from the [Distributed-Something template](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-Something).
The full code changes are available [here](https://github.com/DistributedScience/Distributed-HelloWorld/pull/1/files).

Like any Distributed-Something applicaton, to make it run, a user still needs to add their AWS-account specific information.

Happy Distributing!
